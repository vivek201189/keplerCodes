# keplerCodes
These are the commits for all the work on the Kepler data for the Deep Sky project at the Scalable Software Systems Laboratory at the University of Florida.

Currently, the best test accuracy achieved for the 1-dimensional flux data is 98.20%. This result was achieved with the architecture used in the file named latestKeplerCode_8CNN_98_2

Note: Constant updates are being made to these files and hence, accuracy may eventually improve.
